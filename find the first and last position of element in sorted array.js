// Given an array of integers nums sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

// Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

// If the target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

//     Example 1:

// Input: nums = [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10], target = 8
// Output: [3, 4]
// Example 2:

// Input: nums = [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10], target = 6
// Output: [-1, -1]
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number[]}

// revisiting weak concepts:
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling

 // reservoir sampling: pretend you have a 10 sample size for your reservoir
// for every one beyond that like the 11th sample you would roll a dice that is 1 to 11 
// if you get 5 then 5th sample is replaced by the 11th sample. if you got 11 then move on.
// an element is chosen with probability reserovir size / sample number to join the reservoir 
// an element in the resrovir is chosen at 1/sample number to be TAKEN OUT from the reserovir
// each input has ultimate reservoir size /sample number probability to be chosen to join the reservoir

// re partitioning algos:
// Lomuto: right most is the pivot index/ pivot value
// theres a for loop going from left to right indexed under j 
// if youre smaller than hte pivot an index i keeps track of how many smallers there have been with i++ and swaps j with i 
// after for loop with j concludes swap i which is how many smallers there have been with the pivot (aka j)
// not as good as the original Hoare partition
// hoare is the goood quicksort partiiton where yotu swap any wrong rights with wrong lefts until theres crossover (make sure you move on after swap with a left++ and right--)
